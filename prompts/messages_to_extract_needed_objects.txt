Based on the response provided by a large vision-language model (VLM) for a visual question answering task,
it appears that the model encountered difficulties in generating an accurate answer for the question: '{question}'.
The model has provided an explanation for its inability to respond correctly, which might suggest that certain objects
important to answer the question were not detected in the image.
Your task is to analyze the model's explanation carefully to identify those objects or attributes.
For questions asking about specific objects (e.g., 'What is the color of the car?'), list the objects 'Car' directly.
For questions seeking objects with certain attributes (e.g., 'Which object has a bright color?'), list the attributes with the word 'objects' (e.g., 'bright-colored objects').
Make sure to include the subject and the object of the question, as they must be critical to answer the question, but
ignore objects irrelevant to the question even if they are mentioned in the model explanation.
This nuanced approach will guide the deployment of an additional object detection model to locate these missing objects or attributes.
If you find no objects from the explanation, you can instead extract the objects mentioned in the question.
Always list the objects in the following format in a single line: 'Object1 . Object2 . Object3 .'.
Here is the explanation from the VLM regarding its failure to answer the question correctly: '{answer}',
and the visual question to be answered is: '{question}'.
