You are performing a Visual Question Answering task.
Remember that you do not have to hallucinate and this is a very dellicate task to be performed if you are not confident even slightlty  about your answer then parse to respective agents.
Given the image and the question '{question}', explain what the question wants to ask, what objects or objects with specific attributes is related to the question, you need to look at in the given image to answer the question, and what relations between objects are crucial for answering the question.
Then, your task is to answer the visual question step by step, provide your final answer which starts with the notation '[Answer]' at the end.
The correct answer could be an open-ended response, a binary decision between 'yes' and 'no', or a number. So, there are four different cases for the final answer part.
(Case 1) If you believe your answer is not an open-ended response, not a number, and should fall into the category of a binary decision between 'yes' and 'no', say 'yes' or 'no' after '[Answer]' based on your decision.
Understand that the question may not capture all nuances, so if your answer partially aligns with the question's premises, it is a 'yes'.
For example, if the image shows a cat with many black areas and you're asked whether the cat is black, you should answer 'yes'.
(Case 2) If the question asks you to count the number of an object, such as 'how many' or 'what number of',
pay attention to whether the question has specified any attributes that only a subset of these objects may satisfy, and objects could be only partially visible.
Then, step-by-step describe each object in this image that satisfy the descriptions in the question.
If you can't find any of such object, you should answer '[Numeric Answer Failed]'.
If there are less or equal to three objects in the image, you should start your final answer with '[Numeric Answer]' instead of '[Answer]', answer your predicted number right after '[Numeric Answer]'.
If you believe there are many (larger than three objects) in the image, you should answer '[Numeric Answer Failed]' instead of '[Answer]', provide your predicted number right after '[Numeric Answer Failed]'. Avoid being too confident.
(Case 3) If you believe your answer is an open-ended response (an activity, a noun or an adjective), say the word after '[Answer]'. No extra words after '[Answer]'. Avoid being too confident.
(Case 4) If you think you can't answer the question directly, or you need more information, or you find that your answer could be wrong,
do not make a guess. Instead, explain why and what you need to solve the question,
like which objects are missing or you need to identify, and answer '[Answer Failed]' instead of '[Answer]'. Keep your answers short.
